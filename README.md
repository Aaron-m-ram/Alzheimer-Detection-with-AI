# Alzheimer Detection with AI
Alzheimer's disease poses a significant challenge to modern healthcare systems, due to its continual progression leading to cognitive decline and memory impairment. Timely detection and intervention are crucial for managing the disease effectively. This project aims to develop an AI tool using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are techniques from computer vision and deep learning to analyze MRI scans of the brain for early signs of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we want to categorize the MRI scans based on how severe the disease is affecting the patient. The categories are mild, moderate, very mild and non demented. 
The utilization of CNNs and other models in this research aligns with the course material of computer vision, as it involves the extraction of meaningful patterns and features from visual data. Furthermore, deep learning is used by the multi-layered architecture of CNNs and offers an effective means to represent and interpret the MRI data.
